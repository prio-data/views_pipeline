# views_pipeline
The Violence & Impacts Early Warning System (VIEWS) produces monthly predictions of future violent conflict at both a country and sub-country level of analysis. This repository contains code, configuration files, and documentation that encapsulates the entire process of developing, experimenting, training, evaluating, and deploying the VIEWS machine learning model pipeline.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this pipeline is **actively under construction**. We're in the **early stages of development**, meaning it's **not yet ready for operational use**. We're working hard to bring you a robust and fully-functional tool, so stay tuned for updates!

### Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Code:** Source code for the VIEWS project's machine learning models and the full pipeline.
- **Configuration Files:** Settings and configurations for running the models, ensembles, and orchestration scripts.
- **Documentation:** Detailed instructions and information about the project and how to interact with the pipeline and the individual components.

### Pipeline Overview

The VIEWS machine learning pipeline involves several key processes:

- **Developing:** Creating and refining machine learning models.
- **Experimentation:** Testing and validating various model configurations and approaches.
- **Training:** Training models with relevant data.
- **Evaluating:** Assessing model performance and accuracy.
- **Deploying:** Implementing models in a production environment to generate monthly true-future forecasts 

(to access the generated forecasts, please start here: https://viewsforecasting.org/early-warning-system/user-guide/#data-access).

Each model is contained within its own sub-folder, providing a modular structure for development and deployment.

For further details on how to navigate and utilize this repository, please refer to the documentation (READMEs) provided within each sub-folder.

## Other Documentation
This pipeline repository relies on a lot of previous work documented in other papers and repositories.

The fatalities model generates forecasts for state-based armed conflict during each month in a rolling 3-year window. 
The latest iteration, currently in production, is called [Fatalities002](https://viewsforecasting.org/early-warning-system/models/fatalities002/).
