## Where to Start Guide

Welcome to the repository! This guide will help you navigate the project structure and understand how to get started efficiently.

### 1. Root README
**Start with the Root README.** This file provides an overview of the project, including:
- The project's purpose and goals
- Instructions for setting up the development environment
- Key information you need to get started
- views_pipeline/README.md

This foundational understanding will give you context for everything else in the repository.

### 2. Glossary
**Next, familiarize yourself with the Glossary.** This document defines key terms used throughout the codebase and documentation. Consistent terminology is crucial, so ensure you:
- Understand the definitions provided
- Use these terms consistently in your code and documentation
- views_pipeline/documentation/glossary.md

### 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Review the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).** These documents capture important architectural decisions made during the project’s lifecycle. They provide context and rationale for why certain decisions were made. This is particularly useful if you encounter anything unclear.
- views_pipeline/documentation/ADRs/


### 4. Python Style Guide
**Adhere to the Python Style Guide.** This guide ensures consistency and readability in the codebase. Key points include:
- Follow the conventions outlined to maintain code quality
- Facilitate easier code reviews by adhering to these standards
- views_pipeline/documentation/python_style_guide.md

### 5. Directory-Specific READMEs
**Refer to the Directory-Specific READMEs as needed.** The project is organized into multiple directories, each containing its own README file. These files provide detailed information about the purpose and structure of each directory and its subdirectories. The directory-specific README files should always be consulted before any changes or additions are implemented. 

### 6. Additional Resources
**Consult the following additional resources as needed:**

- **Contributing Guidelines**: If you plan to contribute to the project, read these guidelines to understand the process for submitting changes.

- **Issue Tracker**: Check for any open issues or feature requests. This can give you an idea of the current priorities and ongoing discussions.

- **Code of Conduct**: Review to understand the expectations for behavior within the community.

### 7. Consult the ADRs
**Revisit the ADRs if you encounter any uncertainties.** They are the authoritative source for understanding the architectural decisions made in the project. **This project runs on the philosophy of "if you can't answer it with a link, it is not documented."** As such, all decisions regarding the pipeline architecture should be properly documented with an ADR.

### 8. Terminology Consistency
**Always use the terms defined in the Glossary** in your code and documentation. Consistent terminology helps avoid misunderstandings and makes the codebase easier to navigate.

By following this guide, you’ll have a solid foundation to start working effectively within the repository. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.

Happy coding!
