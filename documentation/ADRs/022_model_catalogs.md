## Context
*We wanted to have a catalog about all of the models in the pipeline. We needed to do that both for the old and the new pipeline because the structure of the two pipelines and the way how the querysets are organised are different. We also had to be sure that the catalogs update whenever a model is modified or added.*

*Describe the issue that necessitated the decision, including any factors considered during the decision-making process. This should provide a clear understanding of the challenges or opportunities addressed by the ADR.*

## Decision
### New pipeline
*In the new pipeline there are two spearate catalogs for 'country level' and 'priogrid level' models with the following structure:*
| Model Name | Algorithm | Target | Input Features | Non-default Hyperparameters | Forecasting Type | Implementation Status | Implementation Date | Author |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| electric_relaxation | RandomForestClassifier | ged_sb_dep | - [escwa001_cflong](https://github.com/prio-data/views_pipeline/blob/main/common_querysets/queryset_electric_relaxation.py) | - [hyperparameters electric_relaxation](https://github.com/prio-data/views_pipeline/blob/main/models/electric_relaxation/configs/config_hyperparameters.py) | None | shadow | NA | Sara |

Configs used to create the catalog:
- `views_pipeline/models/*/configs/config_meta.py`
- `views_pipeline/models/*/configs/config_deployment.py`
- `views_pipeline/models/*/configs/config_hyperparameters.py`
- `views_pipeline/common_querysets/*`

Columns:
- **Model Name**: name of the model, always in a form of `adjective_noun`
- **Algorithm**: "algorithm" from `config_meta.py`
- **Target**: "depvar" from `config_meta.py`
- **Input Features**: "queryset" from `config_meta.py` that points to the queryset in `common_querysets`folder
- **Non-default Hyperparameters**: "hyperparameters model_name" that points to `config_hyperparameters.py`
- **Forecasting Type**: TBD
- **Implementation Status**: "deployment_status" from `config_deployment.py` (e.g. shadow, deployed, baseline, or deprecated)
- **Implementation Date**: TBD
- **Author**: "creator" from `config_meta.py`

### Old Pipeline
*In the old pipeline there is only one catalog that contains both  'country level' and 'priogrid level' models with the following structure:*
| Model Name | Algorithm | Target | Input Features | Non-default Hyperparameters | Forecasting Type | Implementation Status | Implementation Date | Author |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| fatalities002_baseline_rf | XGBRFRegressor | ln_ged_sb_dep | - [fatalities002_baseline](https://github.com/prio-data/viewsforecasting/blob/main/Tools/cm_querysets.py#L16) | n_estimators=300, n_jobs=nj | Direct multi-step | no | NA | NA |

Configs used to create the catalog:
- [ModelDefinitions.py](https://github.com/prio-data/viewsforecasting/blob/main/SystemUpdates/ModelDefinitions.py)
- [cm_querysets.py](https://github.com/prio-data/viewsforecasting/blob/main/Tools/cm_querysets.py)
- [pgm_querysets.py](https://github.com/prio-data/viewsforecasting/blob/main/Tools/pgm_querysets.py)

Columns:
- **Model Name**: "modelname" from `ModelDefinitions.py`
- **Algorithm**: "algorithm" from `ModelDefinitions.py`
- **Target**: "depvar" from `ModelDefinitions.py`
- **Input Features**: "queryset" from `ModelDefinitions.py` pointing to the corresponding line in `cm_querysets.py` or `pgm_querysets.py`
- **Non-default Hyperparameters**: the argument of "algorithm" from `ModelDefinitions.py`
- **Forecasting Type**: Direct multi-step
- **Implementation Status**: no (none of these models are in production)
- **Implementation Date**: TBD
- **Author**: TBD

### GitHub actions
The catalogs are updated via GitHub actions. Action for the new pipeline: [update_views_pipeline_cm_catalog.yml](https://github.com/prio-data/viewsforecasting/blob/github_workflows/.github/workflows/update_views_pipeline_cm_catalog.yml), action for the old pipeline: [check_if_new_model_added.yml](https://github.com/prio-data/views_pipeline/blob/production/.github/workflows/check_if_new_model_added.yml). They trigger when the config files are modified on the `production` and `development` branch. These GitHub actions can also be triggered manually for testing reason.

*Detail the decision that was made, including any alternatives that were considered and the reasons for choosing the implemented solution. Provide enough technical specifics to justify the approach.*

### Overview
*Creating catalogs for 'country level' and 'priogrid level' that update automatically when a model is modified. Separate implementation for the old and the new pipeline.*

*Overview of the decision in a clear and concise manner.*

## Consequences
*Clear overview about our existing models in the `views_pipeline/documentation/catalogs/` directory.*

*Discuss the positive and negative effects of the decision. Include both immediate outcomes and long-term implications for the project's architecture. Highlight how the decision aligns with the challenges outlined in the context.*

**Positive Effects:**
- Our models become trackable and presentable.
- Model features are easily accessible via links. 

**Negative Effects:**
- The github actions and generator scripts require maintenance.
- If the catalogs fail to update, it might remain unnoticed for a while.

## Rationale
*Every information about the models are found at one place*

*Explain the reasoning behind the decision, including any specific advantages that influenced the choice. This section should reflect the factors mentioned in the context.*

### Considerations
*We decided to separate 'country level' and 'priogrid level' models into different catalogs. GitHub actions *

*List any considerations that were part of the decision-making process, such as potential risks, dependency issues, or impacts on existing systems.*

## Additional Notes
Involving GitHub actions led to the separation of `production` and `development`branch, since they cannot push to a protected branch (`production`). More detailed information is found in ADR #023.

## Feedback and Suggestions
*Feedbacks are awaited.*
