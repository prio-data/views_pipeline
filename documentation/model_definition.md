# Model Definition

In the context of the VIEWS pipeline, a model should be understood as:

- a specific instantiation of a machine learning algorithm 
- trained using a predetermined and unique set of hyperpara.meters, 
- on a well-defined set of input features, 
- and targeting a specific outcome target.
- In the case of stepshift models, a model is understood as **all** artifacts necessary to generate a comprehensive 36 month forecast for the specified target.
