# The Purpose of the pipeline:

1. **Maintainability**:
    - **Continuous Maintenance**: the code should be adaptable and easy to update without needing to overhaul the entire code base. This approach ensures long-term sustainability.
    - **Accessibility**: The code should be understandable by any Python-proficient collaborator in the VIEWS team - not just specialists or the original authors.
    - **Documentation**: Well-specified documentation must accompany the code, detailing its purpose and functionality clearly, so that no additional information is needed for understanding.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - **Rapid Testing and Integration**: The pipeline should allow for quick experimentation with new models or ensembles, enabling their fast integration AND removal.
    - **Ease of Modification**: Adding, retiring, or modifying models and ensembles should be straightforward, even by (python-proficient) collaborators who are not the original model or pipeline authors.
    - **Adaptability and modularity**: The process of altering the model lineup should be modular and not require extensive reworking of the overall system/code base.

3. **Scalability**:
    - **Global Expansion**: The pipeline should support scaling up to handle data and models with global coverage - even at highly disaggregate temporal and spatial levels.
    - **Incorporating Uncertainty**: It must be capable of integrating quantification of uncertainty.
    - **Furture-ready** It must be ready for new Levels of Analysis (LOAs), novel models, more features, and additional targets.
    - **Handling Diverse Data**: The system should be versatile enough to include and process various kinds of data, including both structured (tabular) and unstructured data (image/text).

4. **Reliability**:
    - **Automated Execution**: The full production pipeline should run monthly with minimal human intervention.
    - **Robustness in Partial Failure**: In case of a breakdown in certain parts (model or data-pipe issues), the unaffected components should continue operating.
    - **Issue Identification**: Faulty or compromised elements should be easily detectable through quality assurance processes (see below).

5. **Quality Assurance (Monitoring)**:
    - **Input Monitoring**: There should be mechanisms to quickly assess input data for any drift each time forecasts are generated.
    - **Output Monitoring**: Similarly, the output of the models should be evaluated for drift each time forecasts are generated.
    - **Performance Assessment**: Lastly, continuous and timely evaluation of each model's and ensemble's performance is necessary to detect and address any performance drift.

In summary, our pipeline aims to be maintainable, flexible, scalable, reliable, and continuously monitored for quality, ensuring it can adapt, grow, and perform efficiently well into the foreseeable future.
