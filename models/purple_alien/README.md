# purple_alien

## Overview
This folder contains code for the purple_alien model, an adaptation of [HydraNet](https://github.com/Polichinel/HydraNet_001/tree/main), a conflict forecasting network based on a recurrent - approximate baysian - Unet. 

Characteristics:
- A Deep Neural Network
- Using convolutional layers and skip connections (a U-Net)
- Structured in a recurrent manner (Long Short Term Memory)
- Capable of automatically learning and extrapolating (forecasting) spatiotemporal patterns

For more information about the model, check config files and utils.
