VIEWS Zero Baseline model is designed to facilitate generating baseline forecasts.

A zero baseline model, also known as a baseline model or null model, serves as a basic reference point for evaluating the performance of more complex models.

In a zero baseline model:
- There is no predictive power or learning involved.
- It provides a benchmark against which the performance of more sophisticated models can be compared.
- If a model cannot outperform the zero baseline model, it indicates that the model is not learning anything meaningful from the data
