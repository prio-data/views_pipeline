# Common configuration files

This folder contains configuration (config) files defining parameters of multiple or all models (i.e., the entire pipeline).

Currently, this only includes `set_partition.py`, which defines data partitions (i.e., data splits) pertaining to validation, testing, and forecasting. For more information on data partitioning in VIEWS, refer to our [documentation paper](https://viewsforecasting.org/wp-content/uploads/VIEWS_Documentation_Partitioningandtimeshifting_Fatalities002.pdf).
