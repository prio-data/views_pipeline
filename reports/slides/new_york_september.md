### The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Being Prepared

- **Checking the weather forecast**: So you don’t leave the house without an umbrella on a rainy day.

- **Checking your calendar**: To make sure you don’t double-book yourself or miss that very important thing.

- **Checking traffic before your commute**: So you avoid getting stuck in rush hour and get where you need to be on time.

### Why Early Conflict Warning Matters

- **Early Warning Systems** (EWS) provide humanitarian actors with critical information and time for **Early Action**.

- Enable early **resource allocation**, **personnel deployment**, and **evacuation of civilians**.

- Give stakeholders the tools to **anticipate conflict**, **prepare**, and **reduce human suffering**.

# VIEWS: Violence & Impacts Early-Warning System

---
### VIEWS

An advanced **machine learning based** system that delivers **early warnings** of violent conflict by **forecasting** the expected number of future **conflict fatalities** across the globe.


![bg 100% right:60%](image_files/pipeline_diagram001.png)


---


**Global and Local Coverage:** It offers forecasts at both the country level and a detailed grid level (Africa and Middle East for now).

**36-Month Forecasts:** New conflict forecasts are updated every month, projecting expected fatalites each month up to 36 months ahead.

**Humanitarian Focus:** The aim is to empower humanitarian organizations and stakeholders to take early action, minimizing human suffering.

**Minimizes Uncertainty**: Early warnings reduce the unpredictability of conflicts, enabling proactive planning instead of reactive crisis management.

**Accelerates Response**: Being prepared ensures quicker, more coordinated responses, minimizing the delays that cost lives and resources.

**Enhances Agility**: Early alerts give stakeholders the flexibility to adjust their strategies as the situation evolves, ensuring that resources and personnel are deployed effectively.

# VIEWS as a Complement to Traditional Risk Analysis

---

**Systematic Approach:** Reduces cognitive bias by using data-driven analysis to keep critical conflicts on the radar.

**Focusing on Protracted Conflicts:** Ensures long-running conflicts don’t fade from attention.

**Spotlighting Low-Risk but Critical Conflicts:** Highlights conflicts that may be at low risk but carry the potential for devastating outcomes.

**Recognizing Compound Risks:** Identifies hidden conflict patterns exacerbated by interconnected, multi-layered risks.

# The Technology

---

**Conventional ML Models:** Algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM combine insights from large datasets and capture complex patterns for conflict prediction.

**Bespoke Models:** In-house models like HydraNet, a specialized deep learning system, forecast multiple conflict outcomes from complex temporospatial data.

---

**Diverse Data Sources:** The system integrates datasets on conflict events, socioeconomic factors, geography, and governance.

**Ensemble Modeling:** Combines top-performing models into a unified framework, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of forecasts.

**Open Source and Transparent:** Both the data and the code used in VIEWS are publicly available, ensuring transparency and enabling collaboration with the broader research and humanitarian community.

# Tangible Impact: VIEWS in the Real World

---

### Engaging with Policymakers and Practitioners

**Actively collaborate** with policymakers and practitioners to unlock the potential of **AI-driven conflict forecasting** in real-world operations.

Through commissioned research and proof-of-concepts, we leverage our experience and tools to improving their systems for **decision-making and crisis management**.

![bg 110% right:33%](image_files/GFFO.png)

---

### Supporting Strategic Planning and Risk Modeling

Our forecasts supports organizations like **UNHCR, UNESCWA, UNDP, FAO, the German FFO, and the UK FCDO** in strategic planning and risk modeling.

These organizations rely on our forecasts to better anticipate conflict risks and **respond more effectively to emerging crises**.
