Starting December 2023 the VIEWS model development and Deployment team started the construction of a **new development, production, and deployment infrastructure**.

---

The new system is crafted to adhere to the **most current best practices** within the machine learning field, emphasizing the creation of a platform that is **not only robust and reliable but also scalable**.

&nbsp;

The **ESCWA model**, along with several of our core models, is being updated and transitioned to this new framework in the first wave of migrations.

---

**Background:**

The forecasts generated by VIEWS are increasingly being used by policymakers and practitioners in their **decision-making processes**, guiding them through **complex, high-stakes scenarios**. 

&nbsp;

This imposes a set of **demanding requirements** on VIEWS.

**Comprehensive Impact Insights:**
We must produce information beyond the expected level of future violence. The pipeline must be geared to anticipate the impact on food insecurities, access to water, migration, health risks, gendered security issues etc.
