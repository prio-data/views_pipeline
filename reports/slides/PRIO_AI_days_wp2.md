### The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Being Prepared

- **Checking the weather forecast**: So you don‚Äôt leave the house without an umbrella on a rainy day.

- **Checking your calendar**: To make sure you don‚Äôt double-book yourself or miss that very important thing.

- **Checking traffic before your commute**: So you avoid getting stuck in rush hour and get where you need to be on time.

### Why Early Conflict Warning Matters

- **Early Warning Systems** (EWS) provide humanitarian actors with critical information and time for **Early Action**.

- Enable early **resource allocation**, **personnel deployment**, and **evacuation of civilians**.

- Give stakeholders the tools to **anticipate conflict**, **prepare**, and **reduce human suffering**.

#### EWS as Complements to Traditional Risk Analysis


**Systematic Approach:** Reduces cognitive bias by using data-driven analysis to keep critical conflicts on the radar.

**Focusing on Protracted Conflicts:** Ensures long-running conflicts don‚Äôt fade from attention.

**Spotlighting Low-Risk but Critical Conflicts:** Highlights conflicts that may be at low risk but carry the potential for devastating outcomes.

**Recognizing Compound Risks:** Identifies hidden conflict patterns exacerbated by interconnected, multi-layered risks.

**But** advancing precision, reliablity, transparancy, trustworthiness, usefulness, and decision supprot requires new approaches.

---

### Some Challenges in the Current Landscape (1)
- **Evaluating EWS is Complex**: It‚Äôs not always intuitive to determine which forecasts are 'good enough' for decision-making.

- **Gaining Stakeholder Trust is Difficult**: Stakeholders remain skeptical about forecast accuracy and utility.

---


### Some Challenges in the Current Landscape (2)

- **Gap Between Predictions and Concrete Actions**: Current systems struggle to provide actionable insights for decisions like resource allocation or policy recommendations.

- **Uncertainty Estimation Needs Improvement**: Better methods for estimating and communicating uncertainty are crucial.

**1 Leveraging Diverse Data Sources:** Integrate newswire data, GIS information, and satellite imagery to detect early conflict signals, monitor changes in conflict zones, and enhance geographic and temporal precision.

**2 Actor-Based and Interaction Forecasting:** Develop forecasts that capture the behavior and strategies of different actors, accounting for their interactions, evolving trends, and underlying tensions to better understand conflict dynamics.

**3 Tracking Escalation and De-Escalation:** Improve the system's ability to monitor conflict escalation and de-escalation over time, providing more nuanced insights into conflict trajectories.



---

**4 Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty:** Enhance the modeling of uncertainty for both input data and forecasts to ensure predictions are more reliable, transparent, and actionable.

**5 Advanced Forecasting Techniques:** Utilize deep learning architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks, LSTMs, transformers, etc) and other advanced ML methods (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search) for dynamic forecasts that address challenges such as predicting new outbreaks and rapid changes.

**6 Scenario-Based Decision-Support Tools:** Develop tools that enable stakeholders to simulate different conflict scenarios and plan responses, improving preparedness based on evolving risk assessments.

---

**7 Forecasting Broader Humanitarian Impacts:** Expand forecasting to include related humanitarian crises, such as food insecurity, migration, and public health risks, supporting comprehensive decision-making.

**8 Enhancing Transparency and Trustworthiness:** Develop methodologies to ensure AI forecasts are transparent, reliable, and fair. Focus on clear communication of model limitations, robust validation, and clear guidelines to build user trust and confidence.

**9 New Decision-Support Algorithms:** Create algorithms that help organizations allocate resources more effectively based on evolving conflict risk assessments, supporting actionable and strategic decision-making.

---

### **WP2's** Core Objectives in a nusthshell: 

üéØ **Reliable:** Develop models that reliably capture conflict dynamics (escalation, de-escalation, even onset) to provide critical information for timely interventions.

üß≠ **Useful:** Generate actionable insights addressing key questions (who, when, where) and broader impacts (e.g., food insecurity, public health) to guide resource allocation and anticipatory actions.

ü§ù **Trustworthy:** Ensure models can be trusted by different stakeholders through clear communication, appropriate explainability/transparency, and robust validation.
